                      <p style="text-align: justify; font-size:1.25em">I grew up in a village in Southeast China, where I developed an interest in nature while working with my mother on a farm or in the forest. After choosing forestry as my major in college, I became very interested in remote sensing and GIS technologies and how to use them to solve environmental problems. To enhance my knowledge and research experience in environmental studies, I continued graduate education in landscape ecology in China and natural resource management in Europe. My travel as an Erasmus Mundus scholar gave me opportunities to learn about different cultures and landscapes, and I started to think more like a geographer. While studying geography, I gradually trained myself as a spatial analyst for my doctoral research. Working on my dissertation has inspired my long-term career choice as an environmental data scientist, using GIS and data science skills to bridge gaps between science and policy, through collaboration with other cross-sector problem-solvers and innovators.</p>

                <h2 class="text-uppercase">Climate space</h2>
                <p class="item-intro text-muted">The project explores the climatic niche of the mountain pine beetle in North America by answering two research questions: 1) what are the climate-space constraints of beetle outbreak range expansion, and 2) whether and how has the beetle climate space changed during the recent geographical outbreak expansion?</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/_0.png" alt="">
                <p>Over the last two decades, the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) has expanded into northern British Columbia and Alberta, an unprecedented change over the 20th century that has been broadly attributed to a warming climate. We examine whether areas of erupting beetle populations have been simply tracking the climate (with the climatic niche of the beetle remaining static) or whether the beetle range has expanded into a different climate space with the geographical expansion. We computed annual (1996-2015) bioclimatic variables that are known to be relevant for beetle survivorship using interpolated climatic data. We then plotted union and time-series climate spaces to show the climatic constraints of the range expansion. We also used quantile regression combined with a bootstrap test to estimate changes in the thresholds of the beetle’s climate space during range expansion and between the defined core regions and expanded regions. We found that minimum temperatures, and the seasonal variation of temperature, are the variables most constraining the climate space. The medians of constraint variables have been relatively stable. However, the lower-quantile temperatures in the beetle outbreak range have decreased and temperature in the upper quantiles has increased, mirroring a regional increase in temperature variability. Although the long-term climatic changes showed a warmer-trending climate and drier-trending summers in the current beetle-outbreak range, the beetle populations might have also increased their thresholds to minimum temperatures. Our results suggest that the mountain pine beetle has been constrained to warmer space with lower temperature variation but recently has expanded its climate space to colder regions.</p>

                <h2 class="text-uppercase">Species distribution modeling</h2>
                <p class="item-intro text-muted">The project models mountain pine beetle distribution using machine learning to answer the following research questions: 1) how has climate change contributed to the recent MPB range expansion in North America? 2) what is the relative importance of climatic and biotic predictors in the model prediction?</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/02-full_0.png" alt="">
                <p>Aim: Climatic warming is widely attributed as the underlying cause of the recent expansion of mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks, but the evaluation of climatic influences on continental-scale beetle infestations is incomplete. We assessed the relative contribution of climatic and biological factors to the beetle expansion at a continental scale.</p>
                <p>Location: North America.</p>
                <p>Method: We used aerial mapping data from 1997 to 2016 in British Columbia, Alberta and western United States to identify the presence and absence of MPB outbreaks. We included bioclimate, location, beetle pressure, and vegetation variables in the predictor groups. Generalized additive models were applied to detect nonlinear relationship between each predictor and the response variable, and the results were used to transform the predictors. Both transformed and interactive terms among predictor groups were also added into models to evaluate the different impacts of variable groups. Meanwhile, we used a cross-validation method combined with a block sampling approach by grouping 10km grid cells in 65km × 60km blocks and randomly sampling 80% of the data. All predictors were z-scored to compare their contributions. We performed logistic regression with the ‘lasso’ regularization and evaluated models with accuracy and information criterion methods. Finally, we examined the relationship between each climatic and non-climatic predictor and outbreak probability with consideration of impacts from the rest predictors, and the uncertainties of predictions.</p>
                <p>Results: Our best models predicted beetle outbreak across all years with an accuracy of 0.94 and a R-squared of 0.72. Models with additional location and beetle pressure variables explaining spatial and temporal autocorrelation significantly increased predicted outbreak probability from models with bioclimate variables only, however, our models predicted low probability in the northeastern expanded regions. We found that seasonal mean temperatures and their interaction with location variables and tree density are more influential than other predictors. We also found that bioclimate related to beetle dispersal and host susceptibility has higher coefficients than cold-related variables in the models with z-scored predictors. Although the clustering patterns of commission and omission errors were reduced with the increase of model accuracy, omission errors in the northern expanded range remained.</p>
                <p>Main conclusion: Beetle populations have responded strongly to mild climatic warming and reached unprecedented outbreaks in the northern expanded regions. This is likely due to complex interactions between the beetle, hosts and landscape under climate change. Including factors such as local adaptation, species dispersal, evolutionary interactions, and forest management may provide a better understanding of the recent MPB outbreak expansion.</p>

                <h2 class="text-uppercase">Fire suppression</h2>
                <p class="item-intro text-muted">The project evaluates fire suppression and its consequences on vegetation dynamics and fire regimes, and thus its relationship with MPB outbreaks, to answer the following research questions: 1) how has fire suppression contributed to MPB outbreaks in the American West? 2) what are the relative roles of climatic and non-climatic factors in driving MPB outbreaks across spatial scales?</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/03-full_0.png" alt="">
                <p>Fire suppression over the past several decades has substantially impacted the composition of American coniferous forests and is widely claimed to be a major contributing factor of the recent increase of mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks. However, a direct, broad-scale, evaluation of the relationship between fire suppression and beetle outbreaks has been missing. Using multivariate linear models, geographically weighted regression, and cluster analysis, we explored the relationship between fire suppression and MPB-affected acres, and identified the regions where non-climatic factors, including fire suppression, that have been more locally-influential than climatic factors on MPB outbreaks. We found that the number of fires suppressed, stand age, tree density, and vegetation condition class are positively correlated with MPB-affected acres. Forests where disturbance events were allowed were subject to fewer to MPB outbreaks, while forests with intensive forest management activities were more susceptible to beetle attacks. We determined that the suppression of frequent mixed-severity fires has increased stand age, tree density and vegetation departure that became more susceptible to MPB, and with a warming climate, large-scale tree mortality was triggered by MPB. We also found that strong human influences exist widely. Although bioclimatic variables generally weight higher than fire suppression variables on the global level, topographic and anthropogenic factors have significant impacts on MPB outbreaks on the local level. Furthermore, suppression of disturbances has been more predictive of outbreaks particularly in the middle Rockies. Therefore, our results provide support for the role of fire suppression in beetle outbreaks, whose significance varies geographically across to the west.</p>
