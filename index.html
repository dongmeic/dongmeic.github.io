                      <p style="text-align: justify; font-size:1.25em">I grew up in a small village in Southeast China, where I developed a strong interest in nature while working with my mother on the farm or in the forest. I pursued forestry as my major in college and became fascinated by remote sensing and GIS technologies and their potential for solving environmental problems. To further enhance my knowledge and research experience in environmental studies, I continued graduate education in landscape ecology in China and natural resource management in Europe.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size:1.25em">As an Erasmus Mundus scholar, I had the opportunity to travel to different countries, learn about diverse cultures and landscapes, and adopt a more holistic and geographically-informed perspective. During my studies in geography, I honed my skills as a spatial analyst for my doctoral research. Working on my dissertation inspired me to pursue a career as an environmental data scientist, using GIS and data science techniques to bridge gaps between scientific research and policy-making.
                      </p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size:1.25em"> Currently, I work as a data analyst for a regional government agency in the field of urban planning. I enjoy collaborating with a diverse range of professionals and stakeholders to address complex environmental challenges and innovate sustainable solutions. </p>

                <h2 class="text-uppercase">Transportation Data Visualization</h2>
                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Transportation has significant impacts on the environment, including air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and habitat destruction. However, data visualization and modeling can help identify and evaluate potential solutions to these problems, such as promoting the use of public transportation, developing more efficient travel systems, encouraging greener transportation options, and improving urban planning to reduce the need for car travel. By leveraging data to inform decision-making, policymakers and individuals alike can take more effective action to mitigate the environmental impacts of transportation.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/0.png" alt="">
                <p>Motivated by a desire to create positive environmental changes, I have been working on transportation data analysis for regional planners at the Central Lane Metropolitan Planning Organization (CLMPO). I maintain a <a href="https://www.lcog.org/thempo/page/data" target="_blank">data portal</a> to monitor traffic counts, accidents, and ridership, evaluate commuting patterns, and visualize the socioeconomic status of the CLMPO region for transportation planning purposes. I have also worked on data preparation and model evaluation for <a href="https://arcg.is/1511Tm2" target="_blank">three primary models</a> utilized by CLMPO, including UrbanSim, a trip-based travel demand model, and the VisionEval Regional Strategic Planning Model. Additionally, as a cartographer, I have helped planners map out metropolitan transportation improvement and regional transportation planning projects, bike share and bike parking hubs, regional transit stops and routes, pedestrian paths and bike routes, and social equity in transportation. My experience of <a href="https://arcg.is/1Daum8" target="_blank">visualizing</a> and modeling bike counts has inspired me to explore further the study of travel behaviors and urban planning.</p>

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Environmental quality refers to the state of the natural environment and its ability to support life. It encompasses factors such as air and water quality, soil health, and biodiversity. Geographic Information System (GIS) tools are essential in tracking environmental quality as they allow for the collection, analysis, and visualization of geospatial data on various environmental parameters. This enables researchers and policymakers to identify environmental trends, track changes over time, and make informed decisions to mitigate environmental degradation and promote sustainability.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/0.png" alt="">
                <p>I have explored various applications of GIS for evaluating and supporting environmental quality. For instance, I am currently working on Wetland Determination in Oregon to identify conservation areas in planning. In this project, I developed an automated process to match taxlot and wetland determination areas using data wrangling and spatial overlay methods. </p><p> Additionally, I support our regional partner, Eugene Water & Electric Board, in monitoring water quality in Mckenzie Watershed. This involves visualizing forest activities and reporting illegal camping within or near the watershed areas. To accomplish these tasks, I utilized cost-effective GIS automation solutions by employing a combination of various programming languages, streamlining daily or monthly reporting processes. </p><p> Prior to my current role, I examined the relationship between green infrastructure and water quality in New York City as a case study of socio-ecological systems, utilizing various spatial analysis and visualization methods.

                <p>I am currently involved in multiple projects that aim to promote public welfare. One of these projects involves reporting data on Crime Victim and Survivor Services in Lane County. Another project focuses on exploring the relationship between air pollutants and public health in the Oakridge and Westfir regions. Additionally, I have been visualizing survey data from the Homes for Good Waitlist Connect initiative.
                  </p><p>Through my work on the Oakridge Air Quality program, I discovered a strong positive correlation between PM2.5 and the number of claims reported by the All Payer All Claims Reporting Program. This finding has been instrumental in helping secure funding for air quality improvement programs in local communities that are more susceptible to the adverse effects of wildfires.</p><p>Similarly, in the Homes for Good project, I observed that the number of applicants and applications increases with the population size of individuals living in poverty, those with disabilities, and minorities.

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">The carbon cycle refers to the movement of carbon through different reservoirs, including the atmosphere, oceans, and living organisms. Trees play a critical role in the carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and storing it in their biomass and in the soil. To further understand carbon flows between the atmosphere and trees, scientists use a variety of techniques, including remote sensing, field measurements, and modeling, to quantify carbon uptake and release by trees and to monitor changes in forest carbon stocks over time.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/0.png" alt="">
                <p>I have completed two research projects that involved examining carbon flows between the atmosphere and trees. These projects required me to collaborate with scientists across various ecological research fields.</p><p>The <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.2587" target="_blank">first project</a> focused on global forest litterfall patterns over time and provided insights into the dynamics of carbon sinks in forest ecosystems, coupled with anthropogenic footprints. In this project, my primary role involved conducting a literature review and collecting data that contributed to the establishment of the first global litterfall database. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749122014117" target="_blank">more recent project</a> focused on black carbon deposition on canopies and soils and revealed edge effects of carbon sinking in urban systems. In polluted areas, carbon sources from transportation and built-up areas were retained more in trees.</p><p>Overall, these projects gave me a better understanding of carbon storage across scales, from global to city-level. They have also provided me with valuable experience and knowledge in the carbon cycle and its impact on ecosystems.

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Climate change and human activities have had significant impacts on forest ecosystems, including changes in the distribution and composition of tree species, increased forest fires and insect outbreaks, and alterations in the timing and duration of biological processes such as flowering and leaf emergence. These impacts have consequences for the functioning of forest ecosystems, including their ability to provide important ecological services such as carbon storage, water regulation, and biodiversity conservation. Addressing the drivers of forest ecosystem change is crucial for mitigating the impacts of climate change and advocating sustainable forest management.</p>

I was fascinated by the theory of complexity and believed that it could guide me in tackling some of the most challenging environmental problems.</p><p>My research focused on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in western North American forests, which have been accelerated by climate change. Through my research, I found that continental-scale forest insect outbreaks were triggered globally by a warming climate and locally affected by long-term fire exclusion. This research highlighted the interconnectedness of human and natural systems, or socio-ecological systems, which are central to environmental research. Understanding these systems is critical in evaluating the human impacts on ecosystems and taking steps towards conservation.</p><p>My dissertation project taught me the significance of studying complex systems in environmental research. This knowledge has been invaluable in guiding my career in environmental science and will continue to shape my work in the future.
